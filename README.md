Narrowspark Automatic automates the most common tasks of applications, like installing and removing bundles/providers, copying files, boosting dependencies downloads, creating skeletons and other Composer dependencies based configurations.

How Does Narrowspark Automatic Work
------------

Narrowspark Automatic is a Composer plugin that modifies the behavior of the `require`, `update`, `create project`, and `remove` commands. When installing or removing dependencies in a Automatic-enabled application, your Application can perform tasks before and after the execution of Composer tasks.

Consider the following example:
```bash
cd your-project
composer require viserio/console
```

If you execute this command in your Application that doesn't support Narrowspark Automatic, this command will execute in the normal composer require behavior.

> NOTE: The `automatic.json` and composer.json extra key `automatic` are used to configure Narrowspark Automatic with configurators, script executors, custom-configurators and more.

When Narrowspark Automatic is installed in your Application, it will check if a `automatic.json` file or a composer.json extra key with `automatic` exists.
In the above example, Automatic decided which automated tasks need to be run after the installation.

> NOTE: Narrowspark Automatic keeps tracks of the configuration, in a `automatic.lock` file, which must be committed to your code repository.

Using Narrowspark Automatic in New Applications
------------

Include Narrowspark Automatic as a required dependency to your application with this command:
`composer require narrospark/automatic`.

Using Narrowspark Automatic for Skeleton Application
------------

Narrowspark Automatic supports skeleton generation. For example this is your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "type": "project",
    "license": "MIT",
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.2",
        "ext-mbstring": "*",
        "narrowspark/automatic": "^0.3.5",
        "narrowspark/skeleton-generators": "^0.1.0"
    },
    "extra": {
        "app-dir": "app",
        "config-dir": "config",
        "database-dir": "database",
        "public-dir": "public",
        "resources-dir": "resources",
        "routes-dir": "routes",
        "storage-dir": "storage",
        "tests-dir": "tests"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/"
        },
        "exclude-from-classmap": [
            "tests/"
        ]
    },
    "autoload-dev": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\Tests\\": "tests/"
        }
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true
}
```

Automatic search all packages for the package type: `automatic-skeleton`.
If packages are found with this type, all skeletons will be saved in the `automatic.lock` for the runtime. 

This means you can execute the following command: `composer create-project your/project` to create a Automatic-enabled application, Automatic will ask which skeleton should be generated for your application.

Read the [skeleton documentation](doc/SKELETON.md) to learn everything about how to create skeletons for your own application.

Narrowspark Automatic tasks are defined in a `automatic.json` file or in the composer extra key `automatic` and can contain any number of other files and directories. For example, this is the `automatic.json` for `viserio/console`:

```json
{
    "configurators": {
        "providers": {               
            "Viserio\\Component\\Console\\Provider\\ConsoleServiceProvider": ["global"],
            "Viserio\\Component\\Console\\Provider\\LazilyCommandsServiceProvider": ["global"]
        },
        "proxies": {
            "Viserio\\Component\\Console\\Proxy\\Console": ["global"]
        }
    },
    "script-extenders": [
        "Viserio\\Component\\Console\\Automatic\\CerebroScriptExtender"
    ]
}
```

The `providers` and `proxies` option tells Narrowspark Automatic in which environments this `provider`, `proxy` should be enabled automatically (all in this case).

Finally the `script-extenders` option adds a new script executor to the Narrowspark Automatic `auto-scripts`.
Now you can run `viserio console` commands in the `auto-scripts` section of your `composer.json` application file.

The instructions defined in this `automatic.json` file are also used by Narrowspark Automatic when uninstalling dependencies (e.g. `composer remove viserio/console`) to undo all changes.
This means that Automatic can remove the Console Provider and Proxy from the application and remove the script executor from Narrowspark Automatic.

Read the [configuration documentation](doc/CONFIGURATORS.md) to learn everything about how to create configuration for your own packages.

Automatic extends Composer
------------

Narrowspark Automatic adds a parallel downloader with the feature to skip old dependencies tags for a download boost.

With the below example you can see how to add a skip tag to Narrowspark Automatic, with this it will skip all tags of `cakephp` that are older then `3.5`.

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "automatic": {
            "require": {
                "cakephp/cakephp": ">=3.5"
            }
        }
    }
}
``` 

You can skip `auto discovery` for packages with this Narrowspark Automatic key `dont-discover` in your composer.json extra `automatic` section. Use the package name to skip the `auto discovery`, like in this example:

```json
{
    "extra" : {
        "dont-discover": [
            "viserio/console"
        ]
    }
}
```

Auto discovery will now be skipped for `viserio/console`.

Automatic Security Audit
------------
Narrowspark Automatic shows you on every `composer install` and `composer update` known security vulnerabilities for your installed dependencies based on [FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories) database.

If you like to change the default HTTP `timeout = 20` for the downloader, just add `audit` to your composer.json `extra` section, like in this example:

```json
{
    "extra" : {
        "audit": {
            "timeout": "30"
        }
    }
}
```

Testing
-------------

You need to run:
``` bash
$ php vendor/bin/phpunit
```
