Replace this notice by a short README for your feature/bugfix. This will help people
understand your PR and can be used as a start for the documentation.

Additionally:
 - Always add tests and ensure they pass.
 - Update or add documentation if there a missing.
 - Never break backward compatibility.
 - Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest branch where they apply
   (lowest branches are regularly merged to upper ones so they get the fixes too).
 - Features and deprecations must be submitted against the branch "master".
 - Legacy code removals go to the master branch.
